# README
Hello, this is the repository created for Moosa Al-Nimer it uses a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript! It assumes that the user is using a recent version of Google Chrome and has Javascript enabled. The Assets folder in the top leve repository folder belongs to Module 1, and should be imported when viewing any page that requires a reset.css

Each Assessment is within its own folder to help with clarity.  
Here is a list for each assessment and its corresponding folders:  
- HTML and Basic CSS Assesment :  ```HTML_BasicCSS_Assessment```
- CSS Assesment :  ```CSS_Assessment```
- Bootstrap Assessment : ```Bootstrap_Assessment```
- Module 1 Assessment : ```Module-1_Assessment```
- Basic Javascript Assessment : ```Javascript_Basics_Assessment```
- Module 2 Assessment : ```Module-2_Assessment```

# About Module 2
The word guessing game that was created for this module has a set of features. The driving force behind the design decisions was a feeling of fluidity and interactibility with the website. One of the first ways this is present is through the usage of 3D animations. Another way is the use of dynamic track masking. Based on how many correct (or incorrect) words were guessed in a row, the "music intensity" will change to include more (or less) tracks. The user receives a hint of the place that we are "visiting," and have 9 attempts to guess what the location is from.

Module 2 Assessment is the amalgamation of what I have learned and researched for this project. This was my first time using <audio> tags and I learned about some of the use cases regarding it. I never knew the user had to interact with the page before audio is allowed to play! I initially had several tracks and would switch between them when the "music intensity" would increase, but this would cause an awkward pause as more instruments would include reverb whn combined. As a result, I put each instrument into its own audio track and would mute selectively as the intensity changed.

In the CSS file, you may notice some animations named along the format of Example and ExampleTwo. This is because I learned that animations cannot be repeated in Javascript without writing some odd and convolutional code. I found out that animations can be redeployed from Javascript when assigning an animation different to the current one. In order to make meaningful use of this new space, I introduced some variance to each duplicate animation, rather than keeping the keyframes the same. To reduce the computational load created by this page, I kept it minimalistic and made the animations short (from half a second to one second.)

Although the Module 2 website appears simple, it made me reconsider my previous knowledge of Javascript and HTML, and allowed me to further expand my knowledge of this domain. I am greatful for these assessments, since they acted as a constant reminder of why I enjoy coding!
